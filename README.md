# Recipe React App

## Main Goals
-Have a Navbar with the name of the application
-Have multiple React components in a components folder
-Have data stored as state and passed down to multiple components as props (unidirectional dataflow) or have data passed through Context
-Have the data passed down to different components updated (inverse dataflow) through buttons, forms, interactive components, etc.
-Integrate a React styling library or link external CSS stylesheets to style your React app
-Be professional (colors complement each other, font is easy to read, mobile-first design, etc.)

Your app can:
-The first two suggestions are more recommended as fetching data with APIs and using libraries such as React Router DOM are much more significant in practice.
-Integrate dynamic routing to multiple pages through React Router DOM
-Use an API to fetch data and display information in your React app
-Integrate testing (Snapshot, TDD) if you feel that your React app is simple
-Integrate React Redux to manage state and data instead of props and Context
